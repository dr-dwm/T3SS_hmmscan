# T3SS_hmmscan

This is a simple tool to take all the open reading frames identified in a genome or any nucleotide fasta file, convert to amino acids and then run HMMsearch to identify any Type 3 effectors from the attached database. 

The script can easily be run using the t3ss_hmmscan_pipeline.py file if the dependencies are installed.
This is currently being developed as a docker image to ensure ease of use.
